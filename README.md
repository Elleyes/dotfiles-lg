## About

This is a work in progress.

It will evolve in value over time and with work.

In September 2016, I switched from `sublime` to `atom` and added `zsh`, among other dev tools.  I'm sure my interest in their utility will wax and wane to include other tools, as I journey from [Learners Guild](https://learnersguild.org/) coding noob to a more realized and relevant technical startup founder and software engineer. With a few more tools and the help of mentors and friends, I work to gain mastery over the ever evolving coding languages and soft skills that will positively transform me with each work experience.

I am a self-taught coder. Now, as I'm halfway into a ten-month project-based software engineering program, I continue to improve and will likely lean more heavily into front end development. We'll see what the future holds. Many thanks go out to my remarkable peers, and guidance of mentors in and outside of LG. With purpose and these meaningful relationships, I continue to build my arsenal of software development tools.

My journey so far has been optimized with the following, but not limited to, tools that support my development environment.
