## About

This is a work in progress.

It will evolve in value over time and with more work.

In September 2016, I switched from `sublime` to `atom` and added `zsh` and `bash` as a coding noob at [Learners Guild]( ).

Up to that  point, I was self-taught and solo.

Now, I'm five months into a ten month project based program and continue to improve as a self-taught software engineer, but with the remarkable help of my peers and LG professional players guiding me as I build my arsenal.

My ongoing journey to acquire and evolve my coding skills have been optimized with some of these development environment.
